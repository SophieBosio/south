A bright, summery Emacs theme üå±‚òÄÔ∏èüåä

[[./screenshots/primary-screenshot.png]]

I love the [[https://www.nordtheme.com/][Nord theme]] and regularly use the [[https://github.com/doomemacs/themes/tree/master][doom-themes]] port. It's a dark, muted, cool theme that's easy on the eyes.

For some time, I searched for an equivalent light theme to use in the day time, but couldn't find any I liked as much as the Nord theme, so I decided to make my own.

Inspired by Nord, South uses mostly greens and blues, and has low contrast between the different text colours.

The text colours are WCAG AA compliant against the background, except the colour used for the =font-lock-comment-face=, but not WCAG AAA compliant.

I've used the very convenient package [[https://github.com/jasonm23/autothemer][autothemer]] to create the theme, which greatly simplified things.
I'd heartily recommend it.

*Note:*

South is a work in progress and is subject to constant change, at the whims of the +author+ benevolent dictator.

* Installation

*Manual Installation*

Clone this repository, usually to some location within your =.emacs.d= directory:

#+begin_src shell
# With SSH:
git@github.com:SophieBosio/south.git

# With https:
https://github.com/SophieBosio/south.git
#+end_src

And load the file somewhere in your =init.el=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load "path/to/south-theme/south-theme.el")
#+end_src

*use-package*

With Emacs 30+, you can install packages via version control directly with =use-package=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package south-theme
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/SophieBosio/south"
       :rev :newest
       :branch "main"))
#+end_src

* Support

Since I developed South for my own personal use, I have only implemented support for the packages I use or have used. Pull requests welcome for additional support.

Otherwise, you can install the theme, use =M-x find-library RET south-theme RET= to open the source code, edit at will, evaluate the buffer and reload the theme.

Currently, South theme defines faces for font lock faces, implicitly supporting most programming languages, and faces for the following packages:
- =ag=
- =cider=
- =company-mode=
- =consult=
- =corfu=
- =diff-hl=
- =flycheck=
- =lsp-mode=
- =magit=
- =orderless=
- =org-mode=
- =vertico=
